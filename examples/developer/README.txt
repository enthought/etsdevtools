This directory contains a demo of the developer tools in action as a small
Envisage application.   Simply invoke 'run.py' to start an application that
contains only the developer tools. The started app contains only a
"Developer Tools" perspective. The perspective will initially only contain a
couple of the developer plugins.

Use the "View" menu to add or remove plugins from the perspective. Again,
please refer to the documentation for more information on how to use the
plugins and connect them together in various ways to form new tools.

If you encounter any problems or have any questions about how to use the tools,
please post or ask them on the enthought-dev mailing list. Additionally, you
should also feel to report problems by creating 'tickets' on the enthought.com
Trac system.
