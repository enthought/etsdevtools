* Remove the dependency on enthought.util by stopping to use util.numerix.

* Refactor the enthought.debug.fbi module to remove the hardwired dependency
    on the wx backend to traits.

* e.gotcha.plugin/gotcha_editor.py imports a non-existing e.chaco.plot_style.
    This needs to be refactored or gotcha removed.
