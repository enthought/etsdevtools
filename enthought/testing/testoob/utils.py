    Add pickling for 'fields' classes.

    A 'fields' class is a class who's methods all act as fields - accept no
    arguments and for a given class's state always return the same value.

    Useful for 'fields' classes that contain unpickleable members.

    Used in Testoob, http://testoob.sourceforge.net

    A contrived example for a 'fields' class:

      class Titles:
        def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name
        def dr(self):
          return "Dr. " + self.name
        def mr(self):
          return "Mr. " + self.name

    If a method returns an unpickleable value there are two options:
    Default:
      Allow the instance to be pickled. If the method is called on the
      unpickled instance, an UnpickleableFieldError exception is raised.
      There is a possible performance concern here: each return value is
      pickled twice when pickling the instance.

    With disable_unpickleable_fields=True:
      Disallow pickling of instances with a method returning an unpickleable
      object.
