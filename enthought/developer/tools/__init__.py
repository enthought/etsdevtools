#  
#  Enthought developer tools.
#
#  These tools are intended to help developers debug and test Traits-based
#  code running within an Envisage-based application. These tools can all be 
#  easily added to an Envisage-based application by adding the appropriate View
#  extension points to a plugin definition file.
#
#  For the most part, these tools also make heavy use of the DockWindow
#  'feature' capability to implement their functionality. As a result, the
#  appropriate DockWindow features must also be included in the Envisage
#  application by adding the appropriate Feature extensions to a plugin
#  definition file.
