"""
Another demonstration of the ListCanvasEditor using the ImageBrowser tool.

The ImageBrowser tool uses a ListCanvasEditor to display a collection of
Traits image library images specified by their image name. Each item on
the canvas is an ImageItem object, which represents a single image.

For more information about how this program works, refer to the source code
of the ImageBrowser tool (enthought.developer.tools.image_browser.py).

Note: This demo requires the enthought.developer package to be installed.
